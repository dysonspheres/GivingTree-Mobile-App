# GivingTree
2022 Congressional App Challenge Winner! [(TX-26 District)](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/21-tx22/)

GivingTree Mobile Application.

At GivingTree, our purpose is to accelerate the donation process by making it more convenient for people to give away old, but gently used, clothes, toys, books, etc. by utilizing a driver system. 

We created this app with the intention of helping to bridge the gap between those who need donations and those who are willing to donate to others. We wanted to help the community have an efficient way to connect and support each other, especially during a pandemic where donation drives may not be as commonplace. 


OVERVIEW ----

At its core, GivingTree aims to bring the gift of giving and charity to the forefront of our communities. Tasked with assisting elderly and disadvantaged populations, our app was constructed with the intent of partnering with local charitable organizations and nursing homes through a mobile app which could simplify the donation process. GivingTree mainly centers on transforming the donation process into a ride-sharing platform of sorts, whereby donated goods, cards, care packages, etc. are picked up by drivers from households and are delivered directly to accredited donations centers and elderly homes around the community. 

In terms of specific functionalities, our app offers an intuitive and seamless experience for community members reluctant to physically donate goods (for fear of exposure to ongoing viruses, etc) a more safer, contact-free alternative. From the start, users are able to log into their personal account via their email and are brought to a navigation page whereby they are able to select from one of our app’s various services and tools. Users are then able to utilize the in-app map to navigate between numerous charities within the area and choose one they’d like to have their contributions delivered to. After selecting a particular charity and providing a description of the items to be donated, the user is then able to request a driver to pick up their donations, care packages, or letters/cards right from their doorstep. Upon picking up the requested goods, drivers deliver said donations to the user’s requested donation center of choice. For proof of delivery, the driver can submit an image of the donations at the center as well as an itemized tax deduction receipt for the user to save for later use. Additionally, drivers also have the ability to request service hours for each respective delivery they make, incentivizing them to conduct more deliveries.

An integrated firebase system will serve as the primary tool for creating user accounts as well as storing image proof of delivery.
